#PROYECT IMAGE VIEWER

This project can be found in Microsoft's official documentation, [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-windows-forms-picture-viewer-layout?view=vs-2022)

In this first part the buttons do not have functionality yet. 

Is it a blatant copy of that project? yes... but I just need to reinforce concepts.
